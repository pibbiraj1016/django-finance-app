Django Finance App
This project is a Django-based backend system that fetches financial data, stores it in a PostgreSQL database, performs basic backtesting on historical stock data, generates predictions using a pre-trained model, and outputs reports in both JSON and PDF formats. The application is deployed on Heroku and integrates with Alpha Vantage API for financial data.
